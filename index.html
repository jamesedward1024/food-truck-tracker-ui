          <h3>For True "Foodies"</h3>
          <p>
            Every true "foodie" worth their salt knows that some of the best
            food in any city can be found on food trucks - but knowing when and
            where those trucks will be can be next to impossible, and
            discovering new ones often relies on word-of-mouth that is long on
            tales of delicious, but short on actual details.
